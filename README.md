# purescript-ln

**LN PROJECT: WORK IN PROGRESS**

In order to compile, you would need to run "make bower", but, also have my purescript-foreign-extra in ../ This is because i'm using a fork, with custom instances for Maybe and Tuple; for now. FYI.

Mostly auto-generated api helper & types, via ln-interop.

```
src/LN/Api       - contains auto-generated api routines
src/LN/T         - contains auto-generated types
src/LN/T/Convert - contains auto-generated converters, between various types
docs             - contains auto-generated documentation via pulp
```
